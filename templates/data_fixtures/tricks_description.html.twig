{% if trick == 'mute' %}
    The front hand grabs the toe edge either between the toes or in front of the front foot. Variations include the Mute Stiffy, in which a mute grab is performed while straightening both legs, or alternatively, some snowboarders will grab mute and rotate the board frontside 90 degrees.
{% elseif trick == 'bloodyDracula' %}
    A trick in which the rider grabs the tail of the board with both hands. The rear hand grabs the board as it would do it during a regular tail-grab but the front hand blindly reaches for the board behind the riders back.
{% elseif trick == 'cork' %}
    Spins are corked or corkscrew when the axis of the spin allows for the snowboarder to be oriented sideways or upside-down in the air, typically without becoming completely inverted (though the head and shoulders should drop below the relative position of the board). A Double-Cork refers to a rotation in which a snowboarder inverts or orients themselves sideways at two distinct times during an aerial rotation. David Benedek is the originator of the Double-Cork in the Half-pipe, but the Double-Cork is also a very common trick in Big-Air competitions. Shaun White is known for making this trick famous in the half-pipe. Several snowboarders have recently extended the limits of technical snowboarding by performing triple-cork variations, Torstein Horgmo being the first to land one in competition. Mark McMorris originated Backside Triple-Cork 1440's in 2011. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world's first quadruple cork 1800.
{% elseif trick == 'layoutBackflip' %}
    A variation of a regular backflip, but you fully extend your body for the first half of the rotation. This can be done barrel, or more in the wildcat style of backflip.
{% elseif trick == 'jTear' %}
    Inverted frontside 540 with a hand plant in the middle. Originally a variation on the Jacoby Terror Air. This trick was invented by Mike Jacoby for a contest that didn't allow inverted aerials; inverted handplants, however, were acceptable.
{% elseif trick == 'boardslide' %}
    A slide performed where the riders leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle. When performing a frontside boardslide, the snowboarder is facing uphill. When performing a backside boardslide, a snowboarder is facing downhill. This is often confusing to new riders learning the trick because with a frontside boardslide you are moving backward and with a backside boardslide you are moving forward.
{% elseif trick == 'gutterball' %}
    The Gutterball is a one footed (front foot is strapped in and the rear foot is unstrapped ) front boardslide with a backhanded seatbelt nose grab, resembling the body position that someone would have after releasing a bowling ball down a bowling alley. This trick was invented and named by Jeremy Cameron which won him a first place in the Morrow Snowboards "FAME WAR" Best Trick contest in 2009.
{% elseif trick == 'nosePick' %}
    Stalling on an object with the nose of the snowboard, while grabbing frontside, and then jumping back off the object into the jump you came off.
{% elseif trick == 'oneFooted' %}
    Tricks performed with one foot removed from the binding (typically the rear foot) are referred to as one-footed tricks. One footed tricks include fast plants in which the rear foot is dropped and initiates a straight air or rotation, the boneless, which is a fast-plant with a grab; and the no-comply, which is a front-footed fast plant.
{% elseif trick == 'tweak' %}
    A term used in western ski areas for when a trick is highly refined in movement, such as with legs or arms fully extended, to give maximum aesthetic quality to a trick. Demonstrates high technical ability, much like in gymnastics.
